# Cryptocurrencies

**Summary**

the immense universe of cryptocurrencies on the trading market and how cryptocurrencies could be grouped toward creating a classification for developing this new investment product.

**Objectives**

1. Prepare the data for dimensions reduction with PCA and clustering using K-means.
2. Reduce data dimensions using PCA algorithms from sklearn.
3. Predict clusters using cryptocurrencies data using the K-means algorithm form sklearn.
4. Create some plots and data tables to present your results.

**5 Clusters**

PCA (Principal Component Analysis): The cryptocurrencies are very similar to each other so we picked 2 components to view clusters on 3D graph. With the best K-mean 5 cluster, we can view seperate cluster clearly.

**Conclusion**

There are some cryptocurrencies standout the common group. We need to do more research to find out the popularity, infrasture, security of each currency clusters before we make the decision for a new investment product. However, this analysis gives a great picture of the classification of the cryptocurrencies on the trading market.
